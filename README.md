This application is a wayfinding software for a church. When you click "Go To Map," it takes you to a map with some buttons
with a list of locations. When you click a location, a red dot will ping, telling you where you should go.

HELP NEEDED:

I need help adding a "Prayer Request" seciton. This section will simply include four submission fields. A person's name, email, request,
and a check box on whether or not that would like to be followed up with.
